# Usage:
#   comma_execute_and_wait command[,command2[,command3]] [--signals=signal1,signal2,...] \
#                          [--max-wait=max_wait] [--process|--group] [--any|--all] \
#                          [--pid-fifo=<named pipe>]
#
# The function executes the given command(s) (non-option argument) in a background process(es)
# and waits for its completion (or timeout, see below).
#
# To ensure that the correct process ids (PIDs) of the background processes are used, the PIDs
# are confirmed by passing them back from the child process through a named pipe.
#
# The command given to be executed inherits from the original process its environment variables
# but not the shell variables. Therefore, the command must be a self-contained string that can be
# used "as-is":
# - if it is a bash function, this function shall be 'export -f'-ed
# - if the command is a bash function, it shall be prepended with "bash -c"
# - if this bash function calls other functions, those shall be either 'export -f'-ed or sourced
#   anew
# - if some variables are used within a function / script, those variables shall be exported
# - the command shall not contain pipes, output redirection and such; wrap pipelines into functions
#   or scripts; pass the output file name into the function / script being executed and redirect
#   inside
# - etc.
#
# Usually the given command is executed in a separate process group. If the caller is interrupted
# by a signal, the entire process group is terminated. Alternatively, the command may be executed
# as a background process in the same process group. If so, the command may need to provide more
# elaborate signal handling so that a signal sent to a single process would terminate the entire
# process tree, if any. Use '--process' to run the command without creating a new process group
# ('--group', the default).
#
# The '--signals' option specifies signals to wait for. Default is INT,HUP,TERM (signals are
# given as comma-separated list of names). If any of the specified signals arrives, the command
# (process or process group) being executed is killed by the same signal, the signal traps are
# restored to their state prior to the entry into comma_execute_and_wait, and the same signal is
# re-raised (sent to itself), possibly triggering one of the restored traps.
#
# Note that if any of your functions is invoked under bash you may not receive the signal you
# expect (the one you sent earlier to terminate the function being executed). Bash may (likely
# will) intercept the original signal and sent HUP to the process running under it. Thus, your
# code shall be always prepared to handle HUP.
#
# If the custom timeout is provided (in time units and format understood by timeout (1) utility)
# and the command-to-execute takes longer, it is terminated by SIGTERM, traps are restored, and
# the function returns 1. The default timeout is 4294967296 days (about 10 million years),
# effectively infinite. The timeout option is available only in '--group' mode. This option is
# incompatible with '--process' mode.
#
# If multiple commands are given, they are all started in parallel. To avoid system overload,
# the user may write a custom script to invoke comma_execute_and_wait in combination with xargs.
# The unit test in "parallel" directory provides a code template. You shall provide a way to
# distribute signals to all instances to comma_execute_and_wait that are used in this fashion.
#
# The exit code of comma_execute_and_wait equals the exit code of the command-to-execute
# accounting for possible signal handling. If multiple commands are given, the exit code
# by default is zero if all commands succeed, and one if any fails. This can be explicitly
# enforced by '--all' option. If '--any' option is given, however, the exit code is zero
# if at least one command succeeded, and one if all of them fail.
#
# If the function receives a fatal signal early in the execution when it launches background
# processes, it may not capture all the children process ids. In this case, all child processes
# of the caller will be terminated. To avoid this corner case, this function is best used
# when the caller has no other background children created beforehand.
