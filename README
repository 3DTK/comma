comma, a generic library of C++ and python components and command-line utilities for quick and efficient
data manipulation, especially streams of CSV and binary data, protocol packets, structured data (e.g. JSON), etc

== Installation ==

Currently only building from source using CMake is available. (You can generate deb packages using CPack, though.)

Quickest way:

> sudo apt-get install ansible curl
> curl https://gitlab.com/orthographic/comma/blob/master/system/ansible/install.yml > install.yml
> ansible-playbook install.yml

Read install.yml, if interested in manual build.
