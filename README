comma, a generic library of C++ and python components and command-line
utilities for quick and efficient data manipulation, especially streams
of CSV and binary data, protocol packets, structured data (e.g. JSON), etc


INSTALLATION

Currently only building from source using CMake is available. (After building
from source, you can generate deb package using CPack, though.)

Quickest way (works on Ubuntu 18.04 or higher with ansible playbook version 2.5 or higher):

> mkdir ~/src
> cd ~/src
> git clone https://gitlab.com/orthographic/comma.git
> ansible-playbook comma/system/ansible/install.yml --ask-become-pass

Read install.yml, if interested in tweaking build configuration or building manually.
