comma, a generic library of C++ and python components and command-line

INSTALLATION

Currently only building from source using CMake is available. (After building
from source, you can generate deb package using CPack, though.)

Quickest way:

> mkdir ~/src
> cd ~/src
> git clone https://gitlab.com/orthographic/comma.git
> ansible-playbook system/ansible/install.yml

Read install.yml, if interested in tweaking build configuration or building manually.
