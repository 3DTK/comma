This test is VERY resource-hungry, in particular, it consumes almost all
available process ids. Do not attempt to run anything in parallel with this
test. You may also have limited success in attempting to kill it by Ctrl-C.
Just wait for the test to complete, or forcefully end the terminal session
where it is running.

This test verifies the validity of one possible approach to setting traps and
terminating scripts by signals. The approach is based on (recursive) usage of
"kill -P" command. It was considered for implementation in comma_trap, but
never got past the design and prototyping stage. For this reason, and given the
severe load this test puts on the system, disable it by default.
