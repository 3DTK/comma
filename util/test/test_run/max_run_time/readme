Test the --max-run-time option and max_run_time config parameter used by comma-test-run.

The input file can have the following values:

test_ticks:     how long to run the test before normal completion (seconds)
options:        options to use with comma-test-run, e.g. "--max-run-time=..."
config_timeout: value of "max_run_time" parameter in "config" file

Note that the stderr.log file will say there was an error; this is just because the timeout time was reached (as expected).
