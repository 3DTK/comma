echo "third/request/outcome=\"$outcome\""

# 4. Can release resources

cat "$counter" | prepare_for_match "second/request/repeated"

# 8. Someone releases more resources by mistake: in this case (but not in general) shall work,
#    but have no impact, the resource counters shall not go below zero.
# NOTE: shall we keep a track of who occupied resources and flag double-releases by mistake?
# It is harder than it sounds, because in error it is possible to release more than taken,
# which will break resource counter.
